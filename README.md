This is me making a change to the file. 

I am testing if I can make changes on my terminal and send it to the remote. 

This will show if I am doing it right.

The steps I am taking are:
Making the changes
Commit changes
pull request
merge pull request

It looks like you have to save the process for it to change

I will write these steps in Evernote. This will help me with cloning a repo from the remote to my terminal, making changes, commit changes, pull request, then merge pull request.
